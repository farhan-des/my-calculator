## How to use this calculator?

To calculate the audiobook speed in this calculator:

Based on this information, the calculator should automatically calculate the total playing time of the audiobook for a given speed (e.g. 1.25).

1. Enter the total duration of the audiobook.
2. Enter the playback speed of your choice (e.g. 1.25, 2, or 0.5).

Based on this information, the calculator should automatically calculate the total playing time of the audiobook for a given speed (e.g. 1.25).

## Math formula

**Total time in seconds** = \[(Hours \* 3600) + (Minutes \* 60) + Seconds\] / Playback Speed

**Example:** How much time will it take to listen the 4-hour audiobook at 1.5 speed?

4 hours is equal to 3600 \* 4 = 14400 seconds, so:

**Total time in seconds** = 14400 / 1.5

**Total time in seconds** = 9600

To calculate the total time in minutes, divide it by 60:

**Total time in minutes** = 9600 / 60 = 160 minutes

**Answer:** Listening to the 4-hour audiobook at 1.5 speed should take 160 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes).

## Examples

| Time | Playback Speed | Calculated time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 03:20:00 | 1.5 | 02:13:20 |
| 06:50:30 | 2 | 03:25:17 |
| 02:20:44 | 0.75 | 03:07:38 |
| 05:20:20 | 1.25 | 04:16:16 |
| 12:20:00 | 1.5 | 08:13:20 |
